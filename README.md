# snap-preload

Helper library with system functions overrides inside a snap

Currently the library overrides the following functions:

- `initgroups` and `setgroups` to no-op
- `shm_open` and `shm_unlink` to prefix the name with
  `snap.$SNAP_INSTANCE_NAME.`, as required by snaps
- `sem_open` and `sem_unlink`, also fixes the names


## Manual install

To build and install the library run

```sh
$ make
$ make install DESTDIR=/some/path
```


## Run applications with the preload library.

The `snap-preload.so` library is intended to be used under `LD_PRELOAD`, e.g.

```
$ LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/snap-preload.so /usr/bin/myapp ...
```


## Use in a snap

Add the following entries to `snapcraft.yaml` to include the library and
automatically provide the preload to all applications in the snap

```yaml
environment:
  LD_PRELOAD: $SNAP/usr/lib/snap-preload.so

apps:
  snap-preload:
    plugin: make
    source: https://github.com/maas/snap-preload
    source-type: git
```
